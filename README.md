ALSTR is a full algo-trading platform that will include backtesting, forward testing, strategy execution, P&L report generation, AI-influenced strategy optimization, and strategy management via mobile interface.

ALSTR is **very** early in development. That being said, I thought it'd be more fun to build it in public;) If you have any feedback, input, suggestions, advice - **_[hit me up!](mailto:github@ephraimsmith.dev)_**
